            <h2>Mood Diary</h2>
            <!--<h3>By Kristian Gunstone</h3>-->
            <p>Mood diary is a free mood tracker for android. It's made for my 
            personal needs and has been  rapidly developed, using some ideas 
            I thought up years ago.</p>
            <p>The idea comes from a paper-submission form I've used, which had 
            fields for writing down certain things such as mood in a scale 
            from 'very depressed' to 'very elevated', anxiety level, and a 
            few more.</p>
            <img class="image_fit" src="file:///android_asset/paper_mood_diary.jpg"/>
            <div class="just_center">The paper mood diary</div>
            <p>I soon switched to a similar system, but using textfiles instead of 
            paper. I didn't need much more; the important part was the tracking.</p>
            <img class="image_fit" src="file:///android_asset/ascii_mood_diary.jpg"/>
            <div class="just_center">ASCII version</div>
            <p>I wrote some elaborate python scripts to parse the ASCII file into 
            something more practical (i.e JSON), but I didn't spend much time 
            on making fancy-looking graphs. Eventually I forgot about updating 
            the files.</p>
            <img class="image_fit" src="file:///android_asset/json_mood_diary.jpg"/>
            <div class="just_center">Javascript-based graph hack</div>
            <p>Now I've fallen far behind on the logging because of the effort in 
            adding an entry, or not being near a computer with the files. Lame. 
            So, here it is. My attempted solution to this problem. The app 
            itself is pretty simple: add a few measurements you want to note 
            down, and a reminder or two. At the specified time, Mood Diary will 
            appear, asking you to submit the measurements. When it's time to 
            interpret the data, export the entire database, or make a custom 
            CSV which you can import to your favourite spreadsheet or plotting 
            software. Perhaps future versions (or forks) will have an 
            integrated chart.</p>
